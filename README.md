# crabtype


A simplistic typing test in the terminal.

Hugely inspired by [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/).

# Installation
```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/aatukaj/crabtype

```


# Running
Run with default settings
```shell
cargo crabtype

```

Or with optional arguments
```shell
cargo crabtype --words [word_amount]
cargo crabtype --duration [seconds]
```
Note that you can only use one of these at once.
